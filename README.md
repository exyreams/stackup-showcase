Developers or may newcomers often lack a structured platform where they can openly share their projects and receive constructive feedback or guidance from peers, or expertise on the field. This can make the learner unmotivated, & make it difficult to identify areas for improvement and growth in their skill set.

Showcase addresses this problem by providing a dedicated platform that integrates with StackUp, allowing developers to share their projects, receive valuable feedback, and engage with the community. This collaborative environment fosters continuous learning and improvement, helping developers refine their projects and grow their skills.
